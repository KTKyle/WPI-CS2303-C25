    MAIN: 
        - Initializes two variables:
            *integer value which represents three different options of programs the users can call to use
            *character array which represents the name of the file the user wants us to read the data from 
        - Prompts the user to input a number which represent the three functions within sales_functions.c 
        that the user wants to be run on their data
        - Checks the value of the user inputted integer in a series of if statements to then run its respective program
            *Note if the value is not within the alloted 3 values then a custom error message will be printed
        - Promts the user to also insert their text file name which is stored in the character array value to be used later 

sales_functions.c 

    OVERALL_REVENUE: 
        - Initializes a variable of float value to track the total revenue made
        - Takes the user inputted file and calculates the total money generated by customers in that day 
        - Function will add the sum of the number of items sold times the menu price of one item 
            *Ex: Item Code      Items Sold        Menu Price      Purchase Cost
                 1              10                2.0               1.0
                 2              14                10.0              5.0
                 function should return a value of 160.0
    
    OVERALL_PROFIT:
        - Initializes a variable of float value to track the total cost of items 
        - Initializes another variable of type float to keep track of the overall revenue using the OVERALL_REVENUE function
        - Takes the user inputted file and calculates the total profit generated by the store in that day
        - Function will use OVERALL_REVENUE and subtract it by the sum of the items sold time the purchase cost 
            *Ex: Item Code      Items Sold        Menu Price      Purchase Cost
                 1              10                2.0               1.0
