change_calculator.c

    MAIN:
        - Initializes two float values: total and paid (both user inputted values)
        - Prompt user for both values respectively
        - Initialzes another float value: change (the remainder between total and paid)
        - If CHECK_AMOUNT runs to be true (equals 1) call PRINT_FORMATTED using
        variable change as the input
        - If CHECK_AMOUNT runs to be false (equals 0) prints an error message

    CHECK_AMOUNT:
        - Function takes in total and paid as inputs (ones declared in main)
        - Initialzes one int value: check_index (default value is 0, representing false)
        - If the user has paid more than or equal to the total amount,
        sets check_index to 1 (representing true)
        - Returns check_index 

    PRINT_FORMATTED:
        - Functions takes in change as the input (the one initialzed in main)
        - Creates a new variable total_change_in_pennies which converts the input from dollars to cents to easily distribute from later on
        - Creates six new variables utilizing total_change_in_pennies:
            * Divide by a factor related to the cent amount of the value (Ex. 5 dollars divides by 500)
            * Replace the old value of total_change_in_pennies with the remainder (Ex. 5 dollars modulus by 500 then replace total_change_in_pennies with that remainder)
        - Creates five const variables with type int that represent the factors which we break down total_change_in_pennies by each category:
            * FIVE_DOLLARS (500)
            * ONE_DOLLAR (100)
            * QUARTER (25)
            * DIME (10)
            * NICKEL (5)
        - Prints a statement showing the user their change value by only two decimal places
        - Runs a series of if statements only displaying the distribution of bills/coins that are needed as part of their change 
            * Ex. if their change is 3.50:
                # The five dollar bills won't be shown
                # The dimes, nickels, and pennies also won't be shown
            * Output should only show:
                # 3 one dollar bills were needed 
                # 2 quarters were needed
