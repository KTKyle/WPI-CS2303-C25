    - create a function that can read data from the input file and store all relevant data such as: 
        * wins obtained for each team
        * total points scored for each team at that specific meet
    - wins would have to be based on which team scored more points compared to the other team
    - a draw between both teams would result in both teams getting a win 

    - create a function that finds the best team of that given year
    - some form of embedded for loops to sift through the 2d array 
    - using the wins and points arrays initalized in the previous function, figure out which team was better than the other
    
    - create a function that deals with the formatting of the answer to the terminal and the output file using all the data we've collected so far
